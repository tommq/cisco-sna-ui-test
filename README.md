# Cisco New Hire Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## Tools and libraries used
- Create react app with typescript template
- MUI (https://mui.com/) as UI Component library
- styled-components (https://styled-components.com/) for styles

## Tasks:

### Pages

- [ ] Dashboard page
- [ ]  Add Employee Form  page

### Dashboard page features
- [ ]  Display employee information in a table
- [ ]  Allow to sort all table columns in ascending and descending order
- [ ]  Load application data from the supplied JSON file
- [ ]  Contain an `Add Employee` button, which navigates to the `Add Employee Form` page
- [ ]  Update the employee table after adding a new employee

### Assumptions
- Routing library may not be needed for such a simple app, but certainly for anything more complex
- 

### What could be improved
- Error page for 404
- Bundle size
-
